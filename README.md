# Epilepsy Classification using Multi-Sequence MRIâ€™s  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description  
**Epilepsy Classification using Multi-Sequence MRIâ€™s** is a deep learning-based medical imaging project that automatically classifies brain MRI scans to detect epilepsy-related abnormalities. It processes multi-sequence MRI data through preprocessing, feature extraction, and convolutional neural network (CNN) models â€” including a custom CNN and transfer learning with Xception â€” to assist radiologists in early and accurate diagnosis.  
By automating this classification process, the system aims to reduce diagnostic delays, improve clinical decision-making, and support better patient outcomes.
